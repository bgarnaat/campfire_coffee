        <h2 class="center_this">History</h2>
        <p>
          We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. At home you have unlimited time. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. This painting comes right out of your heart. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Trees grow however makes them happy. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.
        </P><br>
        <p>
          With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Let all these things just sort of happen.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You are only limited by your imagination. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.

        <h2 class="center_this">Our Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Let all these things just sort of happen.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Let's do that again. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. We'll play with clouds today.

        <h2 class="center_this">Best Coffee (Recommended Usage)</h2>
        <p>
          You can do it. Let your imagination be your guide. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's make a happy little mountain now.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You gotta think like a tree. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I like to beat the brush. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.

        <h2>Practicing Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          Let's build an almighty mountain. Here's something that's fun. This is the way you take out your flustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Let's get crazy. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll do another happy little painting. Happy painting, God bless. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          At home you have unlimited time. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.

        <h2>Sustaining practicality</h2>
        <p>
          I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Work that paint. Do an almighty painting with us. Now then, let's play.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wash our brush with odorless thinner. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. This is your world. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
