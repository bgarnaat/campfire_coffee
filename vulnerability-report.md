## YOU ARE VULNERABLE

### Vulnerability

#### Exposure

I found an instance of insecure DOR on your data site.  I was able to access the data site even though I do not have the proper authorization.  I was able to view all the proprietary data about your campfire coffee company.

#### Mitigation

Add routing to your website and then include some sort of user authentication when viewing the data section.  This can be implemented with the python code adjustment:

```
if request.method == 'GET' and user.is_authenticated():
```

Before your data view.
