# Public facing page (index.html) is designed to be the landing pad for customers and potential customers.
# this page is designed to invoke a sense of camping and the smell of campfire smoke along with fresh roasted campfire coffee.

# data.html presents estimated sales data for each location.  Can be hooked up to database for more accurate data.
